## Building

1. run `tesrpc` in seperate terminal [`-s 'test'` flags will always create the same account addresses]

1. run `truffle migrate` to deploy the contracts onto your testrpc.

1. Then run `npm run dev` to build the app and serve it on http://localhost:8080

* Recommend MetaMask Chrome extension to access private network on http://localhost:8545
